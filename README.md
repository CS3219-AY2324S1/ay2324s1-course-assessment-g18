## Important Notes

1. Make sure your terminal active directory is pointing to the project folder e.g. `/ay2324s1-course-assessment-g18/web-admin-dashboard` before running any `npm` commands
2. Google Authentication only works when running locally as we need to purchase a domain name to enable functionality on the deployed version.
